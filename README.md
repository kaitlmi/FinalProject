# Final Project: Games on Psychtoolbox

Note: In order to be able to run these files, Psychtoolbox needs to be downloaded before proceeding. 

This project includes fun, classic games that have been coded using Psychtoolbox including Go Fish, Hangman, and Solitaire. 

Hangman: 
You will be playing against a computer and trying to solve as many puzzles as possible in 3 rounds. You will have a choice out of 5 different categories. 

To play: 
1. Open Hangman.m 
2. Run Hangman.m and read and follow all of the instructions.
3. When guessing letters, press the appropriate key on the keyboard without using any repeats. There is no need to press enter here. 
4. When asked at the end of the game if you want to play again, type 'y' and press enter to play again or type 'n' and press enter to exit out of the code.
